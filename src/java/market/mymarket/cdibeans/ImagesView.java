-----------------------------------------------------------------------
JSF Managed Beans annotated as @ManagedBean from javax.faces.bean
is in the process of being deprecated in favor of CDI Beans. Therefore, 
you should use @Named from javax.inject package to designate a managed
bean as a JSF controller class. Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 
beans annotated with @Named is the preferred approach, because CDI 
enables Java EE-wide dependency injection. 
CDI bean is a bean managed by the CDI container.
